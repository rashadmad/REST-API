# REST-API
In this project, you’ll create a REST API using Express. The API will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, as well as adding, updating and deleting courses in the database.  In addition, the project will require users to create an account and log-in to make changes to the database.  In a future project, you'll complete your full stack JavaScript application by using React to create a client for your REST API.  To complete this project, you’ll use your knowledge of REST API design, Node.js, and Express to create API routes, along with the Sequelize ORM for data modeling, validation, and persistence. To test your application, you'll use Postman, a popular application for exploring and testing REST APIs.
